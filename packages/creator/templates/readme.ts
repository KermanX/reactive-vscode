* \`src/extension.ts\` - this is the main file where you write your extension.

## Get started

* Open this repository in VS Code.
* Run \`pnpm install\` to install the dependencies.
* Run \`pnpm dev\` to compile the extension and watch for changes.  
* Press \`F5\` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Run your command from the command palette by pressing (\`Ctrl+Shift+P\` or \`Cmd+Shift+P\` on Mac) and typing \`Hello World\`.
* Set breakpoints in your code inside \`src/extension.ts\` to debug your extension.
* Find output from your extension in the debug console.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in \`src/extension.ts\`.
* You can also reload (\`Ctrl+R\` or \`Cmd+R\` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.
