# Examples

In this section, some examples are provided to help you understand <ReactiveVscode />.

For each example, there are two implementations that achieve the same goal. The first implementation  uses original VSCode API, and the second one uses <ReactiveVscode /> API.

- [Hello Counter](./hello-counter/index.md): A simple example that shows how many times the user has called the `extension.sayHello` command.

- [Theme Detector](./theme-detector/index.md): Detects the user's theme, and show a message accordingly.
