# Get Started

Reactive VSCode is a library that helps you develop Visual Studio Code extensions with [Vue's Reactivity API](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html). We assume you are already familiar with the basic ideas of [Vue's Reactivity API](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html) and [Vue Composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html) before you continue.

## Installation

::: code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i -D reactive-vscode
```

```bash [npm]
npm i -D reactive-vscode
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add reacive-vscode --save-dev
```

:::

## Package Exports

The package exports the following:

- Utility functions and types, like `defineExtension`
- Wrappers of VSCode APIs as composables, like `useActiveTextEditor`
- All exports from `@vue/reactivity`, like `ref`
- Exports that are useful for VSCode extension from `@vue/runtime-core`, like `watchEffect`

Here you can find all the [implemented composables](https://github.com/KermanX/reactive-vscode/tree/main/packages/reactive-vscode/src/composables). They will be documented in the future.
