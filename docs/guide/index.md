# Get Started

Reactive VSCode is a library that helps you develop Visual Studio Code extensions with [Vue's Reactivity API](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html). We assume you are already familiar with the basic ideas of [Vue's Reactivity API](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html) and [Vue Composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html) before you continue.
